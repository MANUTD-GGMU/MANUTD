👋 Hey, I'm MANUTD (Yes, That Red Devil Fan)
 
About Me
 
16-year-old Form 5 student with three obsessions: football tactics, sleek tech, and band anime that makes me blast guitar riffs in my room. When I’m not cramming for exams, you’ll find me either chasing a football or geeking out over Xiaomi’s latest specs. Manchester is red, and my GitHub is (slowly) getting there too.
 
⚽ Football Obsession
 
- Club Loyalty: Die-hard Manchester United fan — "Glory Glory Man United" is my shower anthem (sorry, neighbors) 🔴 .
- On the Pitch: I play AMF (Attacking Midfielder) — channeling my inner Bruno Fernandes with risky through-balls and (attempted) long-range screamers . Still working on his penalty accuracy, though.
- Hero Worship: Bruno Fernandes stan first, human second. Love his high-risk, high-reward playstyle and that "never back down" energy — even if I try not to copy his occasional red-card temper  .
 
🎸 Band Anime Fanatic
 
- Top Picks:
- Girls Band Cry: Binged all 13 episodes in 2 days — that "雑踏、僕らの街" OP still gives me chills .
- BanG Dream!: MyGO!!!!! is my ride-or-die — laughed way too hard at the "great bassist steps on wig" live moment .
- Vibe: Nothing hits like anime bands turning pain into bangers. Low-key practicing air guitar to their tracks pre-match for luck.
 
📱 Tech Sidekicks
 
My daily carry that keeps me functional (and entertained):
 
- Xiaomi 13T Pro: Captures match highlights and streams United games — its camera even makes my terrible passes look good.
- Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro: 12.4-inch 3K 144Hz screen = perfect for analyzing football tactics and binge-watching anime  . 120W fast charge saves me when it dies mid-BanG Dream! marathons.
 
Fun Facts
 
- I once missed a penalty because I was thinking about Bruno’s free-kick technique.
- My Pad’s home screen is split 50/50: football stats apps and anime wallpapers.
- Still waiting for Xiaomi to make a ManUnited-themed phone (Xiaomi 16T Pro "Red Devil Edition", please?).
 
🔭 What’s Next?
 
Trying to merge my interests: maybe code a simple app to track ManUnited Match and anime band release dates. Baby steps, but hey — even Bruno started somewhere.
